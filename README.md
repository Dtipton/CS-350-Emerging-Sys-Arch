# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch

For this class we focused on embedded systems and the greater use of them in regards to Emerging Systems. I have included two of items for this class. The first is a simple program that uses a simpel state machine to turn on and turn off an LED on the board. While the later is the final project of this course which reads in the temperature of the room and utilizes two buttons on the side of the board to increase the temperature. It also uses the UART to simulate data being sent to a server.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project would take in the temperature of the room, it would also allow the user to manually increase the temperature with the two side buttons on the board. Finally it utilizes UART to simulate sending data to a cloud based back end.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I had a pretty good grasp of utilizing the built in documentation for the board and it's headers. This allowed me to make sure I was getting the most of the built in functions that are provided.

Where could you improve?
My grasp of Hex could be much better, and my utilization of C could have been much more optimized. It was very eye opening to use such a low level language compared to Java and Python that I am used to. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This was really the first class were I couldn't find a ton of information on stack overflow, so for the first time I've been really digging into the developer documentation in ways I didn't know before.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The big skills I have picked up from this course have to be the critical thinking and new found knowledge of binary and hex in regards to utilzing a low level language. Before this course I never thought the difference between a signed or unsigned int or using a char as a inter variable.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to make this project maintainbalbe by follwing as many best practices for embedded systems programming as I could. I kept it readable by making sure to comment my code and keep it in logical chunks that are spaced well. It's adaptable by making sure the code utilzies functions and keeps use of Define statements to specific uses only.
